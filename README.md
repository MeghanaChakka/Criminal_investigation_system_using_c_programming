The system also consists of a suspect prediction algorithm. 
 Based on type of case, property, land, love or other entities 
 involved the system studies past cases, it studies past criminal 
 records of those involved and based on this data it provides 
 suggestions of suspected persons in a logical order. 
 
 Criminal Case Suspect prediction Algorithm:
 
 1) first the type of the case on which the prediction algorithm is to be applied is recognised
 
2)After the system predicts the type of the case on which this algorithm is to be applied the prediction 
    graph is generated with one cycle and the nodes of the graph consist of the key values here the key values are generated 
    based on the clues found against and the frequency of the clues found on the particular criteria like love affairs,past criminal 
    records.(general case)
 
3)Based on the study of the suspect's past criminal records character priority queue is generated which consists of information based on the type of the
   person and scales the person's character in the range of 0-9 i.e 0 implies the person is characterless and 9 implies the person 
   possess high quality of character and the possibility of crime done by this person is the least.

4) The system goes through the list of the primary suspects of the particular case and compares the tree generated of their case 
  records with the suspect prediction tree generated by the system and if the comparison process results in the status 1 i.e 
  completely matched and eventually a number of prediction is assigned to the each suspect.(Based on Hamiltonian Cycle)
 
5)Based on the number assigned to each suspect the result of suggestions of the suspects is displayed and the number is assigned based
  on the hash function which takes the key input as the number of edges connected of the graph and converts it into the percentage of the matching 
  and based on the percentage of the matching the number is assigned to the suspect and the end result is the suspect who is found to 
  have the largest number is the criminal who is found guilty in the above case.
